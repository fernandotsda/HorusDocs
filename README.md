> ## Open Api's 
---
```
Horus Open APIs are API routes that clients can request from
```

### Base route

**The base rotue is defined as:** 

```
 http://tsda-horus-YOUR_SERVER.sytes.net:PORT/api/open
```


<span class="tag post"> POST </span>


```
 /report-manager/datalogger
```



> ## Webhooks
---
```
Webhook is a functionality based on the pub-sub concept
```

**Since version 1.4.7, the Horus System is able to send information to different systems or routes. Based on the Webhook concept, Horus NMS sends equipments alarm notification data for those who have subscribed to receive**

**As Webhooks can be treated more as a concept than a functionality, in this documentation we will explain how users can receive Webhooks notifications from Horus Server**

### First case

#### Local Server

**If you have a local Horus Server running on any machine of your possession, follow the steps to integrate the Horus Server with any route of your own**

1. With Horus Server running go to the users section

2. There, choose an user whom will be associated to the Webhooks

3. Go to the API area, at the bottom of the section

4. Add an URI using the following format

```
http://my-application/webhook-route

or

http://my-application:PORT/webhook-route
```


### Second case

#### TSDA Horus Server

**When using TSDA Horus Server, the steps are dastacly reduced**

1. Contact TSDA and inform an user to be associated to the Webhooks


**The user must be a current user of Horus System**



2. Inform TSDA a URI to be reached by Horus Server

**Use the following URI format**

```
http://my-application/webhook-route

or

http://my-application:PORT/webhook-route
```

**Horus Server will send JSON documents as the following example**
